## BannerView Component
### Description
My solution for banner view in SwiftUI is a View Modifier. Which means that it can only be used with another view. But the control over it can be delegated to the view model (or somewhere else) when necessary. 

### How it works
To get a banner view working inside you app you‚Äôll need 2 things:
1. A Swift UI view to connect it to:
```
List {
  ...
} 
.banner(data: $data, showBanner: $isShowing)
```
2. And two binding variables - one that triggers the appearance (and in case of loading - disappearance) of the banner and one with the information you want displayed:
```
@State var isShowing: Bool = false
@State var data: BannerData = BannerData.defaultData()
```


### Additional note
Here is an example of functions you can use to show / dismiss loading view. No additional set up needed.
```
func showLoadingBanner() {
        DispatchQueue.main.async {
            self.bannerData = BannerData(detail: "Loading...", type: .loading)
            self.showBanner = true
        }
    }
    
    func dismissLoadingBanner() {
        DispatchQueue.main.async {
            withAnimation {
                self.showBanner = false
            }
        }
    }
```

## NotificationView Component
### Description
This view started as a way to show user an error without making it an alert. It evolved into a rater subtile notification view - which does not require user to react to it immediately in any way, but allows them to share the bug report in a few clicks.

### How it works
To get a notification view simply call it with default initialiser:
```
NotificationView(type: .info,
                 title: "Update in 2 hours",
                 message: "Please note that the app will be unavailable for 30 minutes later today for maintainance work üõ†Ô∏è",
                 standalone: true)
```

**For the error and warning notifications** make sure to display localised description of an error in message field - it usually is more readable plus it will be exactly the thing user will have an option to report as a bug description. 

Additionally, it‚Äôs possible to disable report a bug feature inside the sharing options - for example, in rare case of the bug is happening inside the feedback pod itself. To do so pass a negative value to the `isFeedbackAvailible` variable inside NotificationViewModel.
