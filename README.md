## BannerView Component 2.0
- New version of banner view has a banner manager as environmental object. This manager is passed through the view hierarchy and is accessible to any view under the one it‚Äôs been initiated in.  
- Can be used through the whole app/pod or initiated only for the part of navigation hierarchy - depending on where you‚Äôll set up environment object.
- The view model doesn‚Äôt have direct access to the banner manager. It has a published variable with banner data and the view is monitoring its changes and calling the banner manager.

### How to set up the banner manager:
Step 1. Find the top view you need banner manager for and add banner manager and BannerView to it.
```
struct YourTopView: View {
    @StateObject var bannerManager = BannerManager()
    
    var body: some View {
        ZStack {
            BannerMainView()
                .environmentObject(bannerManager)
                .zIndex(-1)
            if bannerManager.isPresented {
                BannerView(bannerManager: bannerManager)
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Step 2. Call it inside the view:
```
struct FirstTabView: View {
    @EnvironmentObject var bannerManager: BannerManager
    @ObservedObject var viewModel: FirstTabViewModel
...
}
```

Step 3. Set up .onChange modifier to listen to **published** changes in the view model:
```
.onChange(of: viewModel.bannerData, perform: { _ in
                guard let newData = viewModel.bannerData else { return }
                bannerManager.showBanner(bannerData: newData)
            })
```
<br> **Notes:**
- make sure that you create banner data inside the view model as an optional. Otherwise it will be recreated every time the view is (which is a lot) and onChange modifier will receive the update every time => the screen will freeze;
- environment values (as dismiss) will cease to work when combined with environment object and NavigationLink - the easy fix is to put them inside the buttons, so the main view wouldn't see them ([known SwiftUI bug](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/72919861/presence-of-environment-dismiss-causes-list-to-constantly-rebuild-its-content-o), hopefully will be fixed in the future)

More examples are inside the Preview folder of the banner component - check it out!

### Backlog:
- create a class that will be passing data from view model that can be used by different modes of communication with user - banner, notification and maybe alerts.

## NotificationView Component
### Description
This view started as a way to show user an error without making it an alert. It evolved into a rater subtile notification view - which does not require user to react to it immediately in any way, but allows them to share the bug report in a few clicks.

### How it works
To get a notification view simply call it with default initialiser:
```
NotificationView(type: .info,
                 title: "Update in 2 hours",
                 message: "Please note that the app will be unavailable for 30 minutes later today for maintainance work üõ†Ô∏è",
                 standalone: true)
```

**For the error and warning notifications** make sure to display localised description of an error in message field - it usually is more readable plus it will be exactly the thing user will have an option to report as a bug description. 

Additionally, it‚Äôs possible to disable report a bug feature inside the sharing options - for example, in rare case of the bug is happening inside the feedback pod itself. To do so pass a negative value to the `isFeedbackAvailible` variable inside NotificationViewModel.

## CornerButton Component
### Description
It is essentially a view modifier that allows to add a corner button to any view. Right now corner button has two modes - edit and delete buttons. The icons, background and alignment of the button changes depending on the mode. 
<br> It is possible to add more modes in the future, if needed.

### How it works
It is a very straight forward. Just add this view modifier to the view:
```
.overlayCornerButton(role: .delete) {
           //your function
 }
```

**Notes**: 
<br> - do not use padding on the view before applying this overlay - it will mess the alignment. Add all the paddings after the overlay;
<br> - this component works best if the parent view has corner radius at least 10.
